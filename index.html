Their foolish thought process was that “even if only a small percentage of the people who get my email are interested, I’ll get rich!” Well, that was wrong back then. And it’s still wrong today. Even though there are still lots of foolish spammers trying to prove those of us who know better wrong! It’s sad and funny all at the same time. Many will try to convince you that all you need to do is share your offer with enough people and eventually somebody will say yes! Well, that’s foolish and will only cost you more money and leave you even more frustrated. Need an example? Okay. You could go to a bald convention, selling shampoo. You might luck out and sell a couple bottles to a man who felt sorry for you and figured his wife or daughter could use it. Obviously he doesn’t need it! And that’s the point. There are many misguided fools who actually believe it’s all just a numbers game and it’s part of how marketing works. No. That’s how failure works.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-card-text mbr-fonts-style align-left display-7">MLM genealogy lead lists typically consist of the name, email, telephone etc. of people who signed up as a distributor for various MLM companies. These people are obviously who you want to share your business opportunity with because they are proven buyers who will take action, and they have already proven so. These people have paid in most cases a fee to get started in one program or another and have a genuine interest in network marketing, MLM, high ticket, top tier, gifting and several other related offers etc. Your first and best choice should always be Genealogy leads because <strong>these people are BUYERS.

                        <p class="mbr-card-text mbr-fonts-style align-left display-7">The friends and family approach simply doesn’t work. It will never afford you the true, long term success you are seeking in any opportunity. Many misguided “leaders” will tell you to start with your friends and family. They will tell you it’s the easiest place to get some interested sign ups. The truth is, it’s the last thing you should ever do if you want to maintain a good relationship with those you love and care about. If you’ve been around for a while and already made this mistake, you already know what I’m saying is absolutely true. Be smart. Get genealogy leads.

They are uninformed and lack any initiative with which to build any business. More often than not they are more trouble than they are worth for a whole host of reasons. Save yourself time, resources and money. Stay far away from them! Unscrupulous lead and list brokers love to sell unsuspecting, uninformed newbies a worthless list of business opportunity seekers. Be smart. Don’t fall for it.

                            Smart business owners know the key to success is to keep costs down and facilitate profits as quickly as possible. Most fail in the industry because they work harder instead of smarter. They also don’t have a realistic understanding of what it takes to enjoy real success. They fail to plan which ensures a plan to fail approach by default.

Unlike tire kickers, they will take action when they see something that gets their attention. Statistically speaking the typical person on a genealogy lead list is open to looking at a new opportunity. Properly present a good offer and they may jump on it!

                            Genealogy leads have experience. That’s the bottom line. This means your time, energy and resources will be called upon less than if you were having to try and train total newbies and hold their hand every step of the way. Explaining things like compensation plans, marketing methods and systems, work ethic, dedication, team effort etc. will be easier given their industry experience. This gives you more time freedom to better leverage your time where you should.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text mbr-text display-7">MLM is a great example. MLM companies are well known for having the best compensation plan during their initial pre-launch phase. During this time they want to generate as much interest as possible and also attract as many new distributors as they can. They know the best way to do this is to offer the most lucrative compensation plan. This will create a buzz in the industry and get people talking to their teams etc. This will also cause many who become distributors to also get on auto ship to buy the companies products each month. This concept is called “forced product consumption.” It’s very effective and why many companies wrap the MLM model around their product. However, as is often the case, after a sufficient time period has elapsed and the company feels they have enough momentum going and once the distributor numbers are where they want them, they will change the compensation plan. As you might imagine, it usually favors the company more than it does the distributors. And this tends to upset many. Some are so upset that they choose to leave and look for something else. However, before they go… the smart ones log in to their back office and they download their entire organization. This can include the name, email, telephone, fax, physical address etc.of each person in their organization.<br></p>

Many of them have enjoyed great success and do not require babysitting or training in terms of marketing, sales, coaching etc. Business opportunity seekers tend to be excuse makers and blamer’s who lack the ability to hold themselves accountable for their own personal failures. They also are also more often than not, two things you should want nothing to do with: 1. They are broke. 2. They are lazy. The mindset is the opposite of what you should always look for when sharing your offer. Opportunity seekers tend to lack real drive or ambition. They are difficult to work with and usually want something for nothing. Given the choice, you should do the smart thing and always work with genealogy leads every time. This will save you lots of headaches.<br><br>Another great distinction is that genealogy leads are your best match in terms of targeting your offer with people who are the best fit. It makes sense to always strive to share your offer with those who are the most targeted to receive it based upon carefully chosen criteria. With genealogy leads you have the necessary data to wisely choose who to share your offer with. Opportunity seekers don’t afford you the same abilities. And you can do is hope for the best and use the “shotgun approach” which rarely ever works.</p>

                                       This is an excellent question. It’s also <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>. Many unscrupulous lead and list brokers will try and convince you that scraped or harvested leads are the best. They will tout them as being affordable and targeted. This is far from the truth. The truth is that using scraped or harvested leads is the fastest and easiest way for you to get in to trouble for violating the telemarketing rules. It’s also a good way for you to leave yourself wide open and vulnerable to fines and lots of headaches. Let’s look closer at how scraped or harvested leads are gathered. There are many cheap little software programs that claim to spider the web based upon your search criteria. They claim all you need to do is enter a keyword or company name, and the software will “scrape” or “harvest” the email and or telephone number from the pages it finds that also include your keyword(s) and / or company name(s) etc. To the newbie this sounds like a gold mine. However, to the seasoned marketing veteran, we know better. Scraping  software is just that. It’s software. It only does one thing. You enter a keyword and it spiders the internet looking for pages that contain that keyword. Let’s say for example that there is a forum where many people are talking about a particular company. And let’s say they are all very disgruntled about marketers and their approach etc. And let’s say that none of these people were every actively involved with the company. They are merely venting and sharing their frustrations. And let’s say a few of them shared their telephone number in their forum signature. I think you can see where this is going. The software has no way of knowing any of the above. It only does one thing. And that is scrape or harvest the telephone number from the page. And so now let’s say you used software, or you got a list that was scraped, and the list if comprised of numbers that were gathered in this manner. Can you see how this could be a real problem for you? Keep reading to have your eyes opened wide. The only people who will try and convince you that scraper or harvested leads are great, are the people who are trying to either sell the lists or the cheap software to you. Always remember that. There are people who hate all marketers, especially telemarketers. And these people have gone to great lengths in an effort to stop us. A great example of this is “bait pages”. A bait page is a page that is created with one goal in mind. That is to attract the scrapers and harvesting software and get them to gather the telephone numbers on the pages they have created. Here’s how they do it. First they Google the names of many business opportunities, MLM companies etc. Then they include many keywords that marketers often enter in to the scraper / harvesting software. Then they do something that is incredibly shady. They set up various pages online that include all of the aforementioned keywords, company names etc. And last but not least, they also include the telephone numbers of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission, Attorney General‘s </strong>offices, <strong>law firms </strong>across the USA, and any other agency or individual they feel would cause trouble and headaches for anyone who contacts them with any sort of marketing offer. Sounds pretty scary huh? Well it is. And it is <strong>NOT something you ever want to be part of</strong>. So how do you protect yourself from inadvertently calling any of these people or agencies and putting yourself in the direct line of fire for legal issues, fines, headaches etc. It’s actually very simple. Never contact anyone on any scraped or harvested list. And this is another BIG reason why you should always go with targeted genealogy lead lists every time. They are buyers and you know where they came from. Another very important distinction to make is that <strong>many unscrupulous lead and list brokers sell scraped leads and claim they are genealogy leads</strong>. They are <strong>NOT</strong>. Scraped leads are scraped leads. They were scraped using cheap software. Genealogy leads came direct from the back office of companies. The difference between these types of leads is night and day. Genealogy leads are what you want. Hands down they are the best.</p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text mbr-text display-7">This is an excellent question. First let’s look at what we know about a genealogy lead. Let’s say there is a MLM company with a nutritional juice as the product. Let’s say the start up is $500. and the monthly auto ship to be a distributor is $200. So here’s what we know about the people on this particular genealogy list…<br><br><strong>1.</strong> They are a buyer who has demonstrated they don’t have a problem spending $500. when they like something.<br><strong>2.</strong> They also don’t have a problem spending another $200. a month on auto ship.<br><strong>3.</strong> They also are okay with the MLM business model concept including the compensation plan.<br><strong>4.</strong> They also are open to nutritional health type products. Perhaps they are in to fitness and wellness etc.<br><br>So, if you have a product or service that fits in to the areas of health, wellness, fitness, of course MLM, this would be a highly targeted list for you to share your offer with. The people on this list would be most likely to have a genuine interest in your offer based upon the aforementioned criteria.
<br>
<br>This approach is the very same one that major companies and corporations use to do demographic targeted marketing because it works! Remember, you don’t need to try and reinvent the wheel when it is turning very smoothly. These billion dollar companies have already done the market research for you!</p>

The great news is when using genealogy lists, your efforts are greatly enhanced due to the quality of the people on the lists, as opposed to business opportunity seekers who are typically broke, lazy and full of excuses. If you have been wasting your money and driving yourself nuts trying to share your offer unsuccessfully with opportunity seekers, you will really appreciate the huge difference you can find with genealogy leads! They are experienced, more open and receptive and are often actively looking for something. These things go a long way to help make your efforts easier and much more enjoyable.<br></p>

Do not use a canned recorded message from your upline or sponsor. You do not want to blend in with the rest. You want to stand apart as someone who is unique and can help the prospect achieve their goals.<br><br>2. Do not try to close the sale in the initial message recording.<br><br>3. Use a short, direct to the point initial recorded message. It should give the prospect two options. Go to your site or add to DNC.<br><br>4. Do not give away too much information in the initial call. You want to tease the prospect enough to get them to visit your site.<br><br>5. Always have a double opt-in landing page. Use a compelling headline and a short video that gets people to opt in to your list.</p>

One of those has to do with whether or not you should scrub your lists. Some believe you can get around the rules if you use a “survey” approach instead of a more direct sales approach. Most tend to go with a  “business to business” call approach which is exempt from the DNC. This is because at one time the person operated a home business and listed their business telephone number as a point of contact.

The question of freshness however is dependent upon the kind of list. For example a genealogy list may not have been received yesterday, however it is still a very good, very responsive list. The real question is are the people on the list reachable and interested in offers etc. The answer to that is yes. Genealogy lists have proven to be extremely responsive to the right targeted offer.&nbsp;<br></p>

I have no way of knowing whether or not you are a seasoned marketing veteran with experience prospecting, or someone just getting started. I do know that if you will target a good offer to the right list(s) your response should be very favorable. Nobody can promise or guarantee you sales. Your response will depend largely upon what you are offering and how you are offering it. Think of it like a puzzle. Leads are only one piece of the puzzle to marketing your product, program, service, opportunity, activity etc. Feel free to contact me with any questions about the best ways to approach the leads for maximum impact and results.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>Given the fact that lead prices can vary based upon supply and demand, as well as many other factors, it’s tough to maintain a set price for each list day after day. To try to do so would create too much extra work to maintain, given the large number of available lists.
<br>
<br>I offer essentially 4 lead package price options which are outlined elsewhere on this page. Just scroll to the price section to see the breakdown and available options. I trust you will find them to be of great value to you as a consumer.
<br>
<br>Feel free to contact me for a quote either for a single lead list or available discounts when purchasing multiple lists at the same time.</p>

Usually I am able to offer you a far better value for both the number of leads you get, plus the type of lead list(s) etc. I will always beat any published price for the same authentic genealogy list.

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text mbr-text display-7">This question comes up a lot. It’s a fair question. However, you have to understand there are several variables involved. First, think about all the different brands of products on store shelves… soap, bread, soda, shampoo, the list is endless. The question is how can each company still manage to sell tons of their product despite so much competition? The answer is different people like different things.<br><br>Think about a business opportunity magazine with many ads in the back appearing side by side. The advertisers continue to place their ads and the magazines always do very well in ad sales. This obviously proves the competition doesn’t bother anyone nor slow down their sales. What it boils down to is the actual offer and how it is being presented.
<br>
<br>Speaking of presentation… not everyone is a great presenter. Let’s say Bill, Todd, and Sally managed to get their hands on the same list. Bill is a MLM guy. Todd is doing a Gifting activity. And Sally is in a Top Tier program. So we have three different opportunities. Each being presented by a different person. Now let’s say all three are doing voice broadcasting. And (even though it’s rare) let’s say that somehow Bill, Todd, and Sally managed to all decide to work the same list the same day. The issue then becomes who is interested in which offer. Let’s say the list is 5,000 people who received all three offers. Human nature will dictate that a certain percentage will be open and interested in Bill’s offer… a certain percentage in Todd’s offer… a certain percentage in Sally’s offer. Then on top of that, another thing to consider is the offers themselves. How good are they. Remember, presentation is obviously very important in sales.<br><br>There are many different niches with lots of diversity in each. There are people working MLM, Networking, High Ticket, Top Tier, Direct Sales, Gifting, Affiliate offers etc. and many more. Not everyone who contacts me is looking for the same type of list, as they are each working a large variety of different programs and opportunities.<br><br>Let’s say John is involved in a MLM opportunity. He is going to be interested in other like-minded MLM and Networking prospects. He is looking for people who share his passion, and believe in the long term residual income business model and compensation structure of MLM.<br><br>Let’s say Mary is involved in a Gifting activity. She is going to be interested in other like-mined people who share her passion, and believe in receiving cash in the mail without a product being offered. She is not interested in team building, training etc.<br><br>Let’s say Mike is involved in a High Ticket opportunity. He is going to be interested in other like-minded people who share his passion for the High Ticket, large income per sale business model.<br><br>Let’s say Julie is an affiliate selling other people’s products, programs, services, training courses etc. She is going to be interested in prospects who are willing to spend in the low to mid ticket, sometimes higher price range.<br><br>If you look at the examples above, one easy distinction is that John isn’t interested in gifting leads and Mary isn’t interested in MLM leads. The obvious reason is that the compensation models are completely different. John would be wasting his time trying to recruit people who are passionate about the gifting activity, and likewise Mary would be wasting hers approaching MLM prospects.<br><br>This is one of many reasons why it’s very important who you purchase leads from. You always want to make sure you are sending a good offer to a targeted list that is most likely to be open and receptive to your offer. Then and only then can the “numbers work in your favor” as they say.<br><br>The bottom line is there simply isn’t one list that works for everybody. There are many niche targeted specific lists that will work very well for the right niche respectively. I will discuss your type of offer and strive to get you the best list(s) that are best suited and targeted for your offer.<br><br>Many other lead and list brokers will sell the same list as many times per day as there are people willing to buy it. I pride myself in refusing to follow this unscrupulous business practice. Instead I believe in long term client relationship building and repeat business. I know that the only way this will happen with you is when you have a good result with the list(s) you purchase. I will do all I can to help you get the right offer out to the right list(s). It is not my goal to add to the over saturation of any list. I also spread out the lists when I sell them. For example, if you call me requesting a specific list and I have already sold it earlier in the day and I know someone else is about to send an offer to it, I will tell you. It’s just the fair thing to do. It’s a good ethical business practice.</p>
